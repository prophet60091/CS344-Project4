Hello!

This was fun but quite a struggle.

To make the file simple type "make". Then the grading script can be used. I suggest using ports from 49k-50k but not higher.
With the exception of the starting port, it will automatically find an open one.

I had issues with the authorization. It works on my system but hangs and throws horrible errors on eos. I use strcmp, and
that is he only "odd" thing in those functions. I had to shut them completely off as the error is simply untraceable.
The strcmp returns other than 0, even if my two variables are exactly the same in terms of content. I can't explain that.

NOTE!: There is one issue where it has been random dumping what looks like a stack trace, but I cant trace that either
it's completely endemic to the eos server. It doesn't stop the programming from running and in my testing it needed no
more then 10-15 seconds to complete regardless.
If it does this, it goes to stdout, and when I run the grading script with "> somefile", it doesnt show up there, so
it's easier to read if you output to a file.
